# Wikipics: downloading pictures from Wikipedia

The main examples are named `download_*.py`.

Most of the other files have to do with getting sample URLs
to download Wikipedia images of an approximate size, to
make demonstrations that are not too quick nor too slow.


## Starting files

* `spinner.py`: example of character-based animation on the terminal
* `wikipics.py`: library to get URLs of sample images; function `get_sample_url(size)` returns the URL of a file of approximately `size` bytes.
