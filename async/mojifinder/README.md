Examples from _Fluent Python, Second Edition_â€”Chapter 22, _Asynchronous Programming_.

## How to run `web_mojifinder.py`

`web_mojifinder.py` is a Web application built with _[FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)_.
To run it, first install _FastAPI_ and an ASGI server.
The application was tested with _[Uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/)_.

```
$ pip install fastapi uvicorn
```

Now you can use `uvicorn` to run the app.

```
$ uvicorn web_mojifinder:app
```

Finally, visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/ with your browser to see the search form.
